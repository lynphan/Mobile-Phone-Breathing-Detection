# Mobile Phone Breathing Detection

Lyn Cassandra Phan - Georgia Tech Brain Music Lab

The goal of this project was to build a cross-platform app to accurately detect breathing using a fast and efficient peak detection algorithm I designed. The app has full logging capabilities and is designed to be easily extended and used in a lab environment to gather data.

The platform chosen was Unity, due to easier compatibility, as well as ease of development since this project was built during one Fall 2020 semester at Georgia Tech. The original prototype was demoed during Spring 2020.

The project is functional but documentation is still a work in progress. Documentation about the algorithm used and procedure will be coming shortly, in addition to videos and pictures. 

If you still want to try it out: BreathingDetection/bin/Android/build.apk is the most recent Android build of the software.
